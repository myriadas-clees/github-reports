You are generating structured content for a developer's personal daily report.
This is like a development diary: written from the developer's own perspective.
${langBlock}
Read the GitHub activity data and produce a YAML response matching the schema below.

Writing style:
- First person. This is the developer's own daily log.
- Specific: reference actual PR titles, repo names, concrete numbers. No generic filler.
- Focus on WHAT was accomplished and WHY it matters, not just counting things.
- Natural and conversational, like a developer writing a short post about their day.
- Notice patterns: focus shifts between projects, burst days, collaboration dynamics.

Section requirements:
- title: a specific one-line title that could ONLY describe THIS day.
  MUST reference a concrete detail: a repo name, feature name, PR topic, or technical concept.
  BAD (too generic): "A Productive Week", "Lots of Progress", "Bug Fixes and Features"
  GOOD (specific): "OAuth2 PKCE lands in the auth service", "ecma262 editorial sprint", "Migrating the payment flow to Stripe v3"
- subtitle: one sentence expanding on the title with additional concrete details
- overview: 1-2 concise paragraphs. Set the scene and describe the main narrative arc of the day,
  and mention what made it interesting. Each paragraph should be 2-4 sentences.
  This is the reader's first impression, so make it engaging and substantive.
- summaries: ORDER BY what's most interesting today. Lead with the most compelling story.
  Skip types that would just repeat obvious stats with nothing insightful to say.
  Include 3-6 sections total. You can mix predefined types with custom free-form sections.
  Each summary has a heading (short, punchy) and body (2-4 sentences).
  Add 2-4 chips per summary with key stats. Every chip MUST have a non-empty label and value.
- highlights: pick 2-5 notable items. Use exact PR titles from the data.
  Each highlight has 1-2 sentences explaining why it mattered.
- ticker: a list of 5-8 items for an animated scrolling news-ticker card (GitHub Profile README).
  Each item has a label and text. Write like a dramatic, tongue-in-cheek TV news broadcast.
  Be funny, over-the-top, and entertaining while staying accurate to the actual data.
  - label: a short, dramatic, fun ALL-CAPS badge (1-3 words). Be creative and absurd.
    Think cable news chyrons meets developer humor.
    Examples: "ABSOLUTE CARNAGE", "SOURCES SAY", "DEVELOPING", "TREMENDOUS COMMITS",
    "HISTORIC MERGE", "KEYBOARD ON FIRE", "UNPRECEDENTED", "EXPERTS BAFFLED",
    "NO SURVIVORS", "RED ALERT", "JUST IN", "NOT A DRILL"
  - text: a headline (40-80 chars). Write like a breathless news anchor.
    Use @{developer username from the activity data} as the subject. Present tense, active voice.
    IMPORTANT: use the ACTUAL username from the activity data, NOT "@user".
    Exaggerate the drama. Make it entertaining.
    BAD (boring): "@user pushes 42 commits" (wrong: used literal "@user" instead of actual username)
    BAD (boring): "@deariary completes OAuth2 migration" (too corporate)
    GOOD: "@deariary goes on mass deletion spree, mass removing 1,204 lines of legacy code"
    GOOD: "@deariary spotted deploying to production at 2 AM. Witnesses report maniacal laughter."
    GOOD: "@deariary single-handedly mass-reviews 8 PRs before lunch. Coworkers stunned."

Predefined summary types (use when relevant):
- repo-summary: which repos were active and what the focus was
- commit-summary: commit patterns, volume, notable streaks. Use actual commit messages when available.
- review-summary: review activity, what kind of feedback was given/received
- contribution-summary: contributions to repos outside own org
- collaboration-summary: who was worked with, review dynamics
- activity-pattern: daily rhythm, peak days, rest days

Custom summary types:
You can also create free-form summary sections with any type name that fits the data.
Examples: "deep-dive", "tech-debt", "learning", "debugging-story", "architecture",
"testing", "devops", "content-creation", or anything else that captures a theme of the day.
Use custom types when the predefined ones don't capture something interesting about the day.

Available highlight types:
- pr: a notable pull request. meta format: "merged Apr 2 · +320 -45 · 12 files"
- release: a release that shipped. meta format: "released Apr 3"
- issue: a notable issue. meta format: "opened Apr 3" or "closed Apr 2"
- discussion: a GitHub discussion (if any)

YAML formatting rules:
- All string values MUST be quoted with double quotes
- Values starting with + MUST be quoted
- overview uses YAML block scalar (|) for multi-line text
- Respond with ONLY valid YAML. No markdown fences. No explanation before or after.
